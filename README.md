# CodeTimers
####by Ashley Woon

A Processing sketch connected to an ESP32, push button, LED, and potentiometer, CodeTimers displays two different graphics displays triggered by timers.
When the potentiometer is adjusted a slideshow of images will either speed up or slow down. By clicking different objects onscreen a timer will start to change the color of that object as well as the background.
